### Petronas
From the talk given by Mr. Ninderjit Singh, we got to know
about the infrastructure services that Petronas has and we
also had learned about how Petronas utilize their
technologies in order to communicate with the other branch
or client throughout the world. Not only that, they also have
a cybersecurity team in each department which control the
access of their respective data and protect it from the
outsiders.
On the other hand, Mr. Roman provided us with the skills
that are crucial and required in Software Engineering field
such as analytical thinking and problem-solving skills as well
as programming skills. He also gave us the information about
what kind of software and technologies that the software
engineers of Petronas use in their daily task to manage their
data and systems.

### Huawei
From this visit, we had gained the knowledge about Huaweiâ€™s
technologies and how it functions in real world. It is not only help
the community to live their lives more efficiently, but it also
contribute in education with the invention of smart boards. This
board can help the lecturers to teach the students easily by not
using any physical tools or books. So, both the lecturers and
students can access their study materials virtually without
bringing any laptops or books to the classes.
Furthermore, the "Intelligent Wind Power Network Solution"
technology that Huawei is developing, which offers easy access
and real-time data backhaul,
impressed us.

<h2>Reflections</h2>

Personally, what can I do to be a good system developer in the next four years is by sharpening and
honing my problem solving skills. In addition, I need to enhance my communication skills because I will need to
engage with my clients and understand their needs. Lastly, I need to have the ability to learn continuously as the
technology is advancing from time to time. So, by having those abilities I can improve what am I lacking and get
much experienced in my job as a developer.
