<h2>Reflections</h2>

<b> What do I get ? </b>

- I have learned about the basic components and hardwares of the computer and how to assemble as well as disassemble them
- Besides, I learned how to work as a team and interact with each other because I need to work in team to assemble/disassemble the PC components

<b> Suggestion for improvement </b>

- The PC components should be upgraded or replaced because it seems old and might be damaged in the future
