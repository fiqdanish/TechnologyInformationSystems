<h2>Reflections</h2>

My goals with regard to my course which is data engineering are I want to sharpen my skill and
basic knowledge in computing and programming language. I want to master atleast 3 basic
languages of programming such as C++, python and php by the end of this course. In addition, I
hope that I can develop a skill to analyse the data that I have collected and visualize it in a good
way. So, I can develop the ability in using the data to benefit my organization.
This design thinking project makes an impact on my goals because the topic that my group did is
related to database systems. From this project, I could learn how the database systems work and
get a better understanding about the challenges that developers faced while managing their data.
I have gained some knowledge about data handling and visualization due to this experience with
Mr Aris. It is such a good experience for me because I can use the knowledge that I got and
apply it to my studies in this course.
I think the improvement that needs to be made for myself in order to improve my potential in
industry is mainly communication skills. The reason is because all of the companies want to find
someone that can communicate clearly. This is an important skill for employees because it will
increase our confidence when we interact and engage with other people. Thus, we will be able to
cooperate with others in doing the tasks that involve teamworks. We will also bring a good image
and reputation of our company to others. In addition, I also need to improve my time
management as it is crucial in the work environment. I need to learn how to manage my time
properly and to work under pressure whenever I am assigned to handle a big project. It is one of
the key components that I should have to succeed in my career.
